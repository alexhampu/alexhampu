## Hello world, I am **Alex** 🙂

Nice to meet you.

## What do I do?

### 💾 Software development

##### Front-end
* Basic stuff (HTML, CSS, JS)
* SCSS
* TypeScript
* Angular
* VueJS
* React
* CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind and anything you need, it's plain HTML and CSS)
* AlpineJS

##### Back-end
* PHP (LaravelLiveWire, CodeIgniter, Wordpress)
* Java (Java EE, Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Hibernate)
* NodeJS (Express.js, Koa)

##### Mobile
* Ionic
* React Native

### 🥰 Hobbies
* Games (PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 421, Xbox 64... I don't care what platform it is as long as the games are fun and can be played)  
* Photography

## What do I like?
* Linux
* Windows
* Firefox
* JetBrains
* Open-source

## What do I hate?
* iOS _(I appreciate the stability of the platform, but I hate the fact that it's too restricted, but hey... you can't have both)_
* Safari on iOS _(the new Internet Explorer unfortunately)_
* Internet Explorer _(version 11 is better then any of the previous versions, and I can handle cross-browser compatibility, but I would rather let it die in peace)_
* Chrome _(because it's almost a monopoly, even though I like it as a browser, I would rather have a competitor to it)_
